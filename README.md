## Weather Dashbord

Click [here](https://jenstem.github.io/work-day-scheduler/) to see the website.

## Description

As a current student, I wanted to create a work day scheduler that would display the current date.  The scheduler would allow the user to see what was coming up on their current schedule by showing each time block in a different color for past, present and future.

When the user types something in to their schedule and clicks the save button to the corresponding time block, the event is saved to local storage even if the user refreshes the page.

## User Story

AS A traveler\
I WANT to see the weather outlook for multiple cities\
SO THAT I can plan a trip accordingly

## Acceptance Criteria

GIVEN a weather dashboard with form inputs\
WHEN I search for a city\
THEN I am presented with current and future conditions for that city and that city is added to the search history\
WHEN I view current weather conditions for that city\
THEN I am presented with the city name, the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, and the the wind speed\
WHEN I view future weather conditions for that city\
THEN I am presented with a 5-day forecast that displays the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the wind speed, and the humidity\
WHEN I click on a city in the search history\
THEN I am again presented with current and future conditions for that city\

## Notes:

I received help from a tutor, [Scott Everett](https://calendly.com/fsf-tutor-team/scott-everett?month=2023-06).

I borrowed and changed code from user [teddysm](https://github.com/teddysm/WeatherDashboard).

I also received help from BCS Learning Assistants and I phoned a friend.
